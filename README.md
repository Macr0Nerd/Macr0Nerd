My name is Gabe, and I'm a cybersecurity student looking to go into ethical hacking. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with tech and programming a lot, and this GitHub is where I put a lot of that. I had my own Gitea server, but I use GitHub more anyways so it was more practical to just maintain this Github.
