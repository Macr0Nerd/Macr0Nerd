My name is Gabe, and I'm a cybersecurity student looking to go into ethical hacking. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with tech and programming a lot, and this GitHub is where I put a lot of that. I eventually plan to make my own git server, but this will stay up irregardless. Thanks for visiting!

## Mirror
I  have since moved on to using my own self-hosted Gitea server, but this Github has too much history and connections for me to trash it. It will serve as an easy mirror of my existing repos, and if they're of importance, I may or may not add new projects here as well. You can find my Gitea server [here](https://git.groncyber.com)!
